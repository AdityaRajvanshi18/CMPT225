
The total running time required to push n items onto the Stack would be O(1) time. 
If the Stack is empty, both head and tail point to the new element.
Otherwise, the last element is set to point to the new element, and the tail is set to point to the new element as well.
These are O(1) time complexity steps, therefore the time complexity of push is O(1)


The time complexity of the pop function is O(n).
This is because, if the Stack is not empty, then two pointers must iterate through the entire Stack to reach the top and second elements.
Only after that, the top element's data can be stored and returned, while the second element then points to NULL and is set as the top of the stack.
A while loop was used to iterate through the stack, which is an O(n) operation.
