**Data Structures and Programming**

All the code in this class was written in C++

These were the following projects:
1. Created a walk-in clinic patient registration system with the ability to add, remove, sort, and view a list of patients.
2. Exercises on stakcs, queues and text parsing.
3. Wrote a bank line simulator program using priority queues, where the number of tills + list of customers must be provided and average processing times at each till is returned. 
4. Developed a huffman compression/decompression algorithm using tree data structures
